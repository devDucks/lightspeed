A new lightweight and digestable protocol to talk to astronomical devices

# Actual state of the art
If I had to guess, today there are mainly two protocols to talk to astronomical devices (with one coming to life soon):
- ASCOM => the de-facto standard for Windows
- INDI => the de-facto standard on Linux
- ASCOM/Alpaca => wants to be an ASCOM without COM that runs on all major platforms (Linux, MacOS and Windows)

Let's look at pros/cons of these solutions.
